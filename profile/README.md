# Moon4k Dev

This is the Github org for Moon4K and everything related to it!

Moon4K was originally being programmed in the [Haxe](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe) programming language, using open source technologies [Lime](https://github.com/openfl/lime), [OpenFL](https://github.com/openfl/openfl), and [HaxeFlixel](https://github.com/haxeflixel/flixel). But now it's being programmed in C++, using my open source game engine [Hamburger Engine](https://github.com/hamburgerEngine/hamburgerEngine).

You can view the legacy (haxeflixel) version of Moon4K [here](https://github.com/Moon4K-Dev/Moon4K-Legacy/). The newer Hamburger Engine version is being developed [here](https://github.com/Moon4K-Dev/Moon4K-HE/)
